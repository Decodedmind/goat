      <h2>Who is J.cole?</h2>
      <p>
        J. Cole is a rapper and producer who has achieved success in the early
        2010s. Since signing to Jay Z’s Roc Nation, he has toured worldwide,
        sold huge amounts of records, produced for Kendrick Lamar and even come
        to the attention of Barack Obama. Along with establishing his own
        nonprofit foundation, he keeps up a busy release schedule. No wonder
        Drake paid him the highest compliment: “You are looking at one of the
        smartest, greatest, most legendary artists of our generation.”

      <h2>Early Life.</h2>
      <p>
        Jermaine Lamarr Cole was born on January 28, 1985, at a U.S. Army base
        in Frankfurt, then in West Germany. His father, an African American
        soldier, left his mother, a white German postal worker, when Cole was a
        baby. She moved with him and his older brother, Zach, to Fayetteville,
        North Carolina, where the family lived in trailer parks as she struggled
        to make ends meet. His mom eventually remarried — Cole's stepfather was
        also in the Army — and the family relocated to a nicer home. However,
        the marriage crumbled and the family lost the house as Cole was about to
        leave for college. His stepfather had become abusive, particularly
        toward Zach; after the marriage ended, Cole's mother became addicted to
        crack under the influence of a new boyfriend. It was in Fayetteville
        that Cole's passion for music found an early outlet when he joined the
        Terry Sanford Orchestra as a violinist. He also began to teach himself
        rapping and production, rapping first as Blaza, then as Therapist — “We
        used to look through the dictionary for rap names,” he recalled later —
        before hooking up with a local group called Bomm Sheltuh.

      <h2>Roc Nation.</h2>
      <p>
        His debut mixtape, The Come Up, also came out in 2007. It was largely
        self-produced, but also saw him rapping over beats from Kanye West,
        Large Professor and Just Blaze. A track called "Lights Please" from his
        second mixtape, The Warm Up (2009), came to the attention of the
        producer and music exec Mark Pitts, who played it to Jay Z. Ironically,
        Cole had attempted to give Jay Z a copy himself, after waiting outside a
        studio to meet his idol for three hours — only to be rebuffed with the
        line “Man, I don't want that trash.” But Pitts had Jay Z's ear, and the
        mogul was impressed with what he heard. Cole signed to Roc Nation and
        started to appear as a guest on tracks by Wale, Jay Z and Talib Kweli.
